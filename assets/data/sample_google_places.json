        "text": "The worst sushi ever had in NYC. I had two rolls poorly made (tearing apart when picked up) to take away, which were prepared in hardly enough time to be actually fresh (moreover one of them was a tempura). The Ebi tempura roll did not have a proper japanese tempura inside, but rather an oily and over-fried, smelly shrimp, and the Eel and avocado roll had no fresh and raw eel, but rather a canned one! Such a big disappointment. Also the soy sauce was way too salted for normal! This can be the \"good\" Japanese restaurant just for those who know nothing of sushi and Japanese cuisine and want to have a RELATIVELY cheap (but still overpriced dir the very low quality you get) fake sushi experience. \nWill never be back, sorry. \nP.S. The venue is also terrible to done in: no Japanese interior at all, just one noisy squared room with commercial cheap interiors and no taste, and tables way too close to each other to enjoy some privacy.",

It would have been proper to ask us to sit at the bar, but they opted to tell us to come back.  I should have taken this as a sign and cancelled my reservation.  The only good thing besides the service were the appetizers. I couldn't eat 1/3 of my chicken teriyaki because parts of it I could not chew - it was hard (felt like old, reheated chicken). I ordered the mango ice cream and it was gummy and unappetizing. How you can mess up ice cream I will never know.  It had a pasty, almost clay-like taste.  Would not go back.  Was not worth the $38.",
